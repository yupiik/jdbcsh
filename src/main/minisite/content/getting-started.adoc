JDBCsh is a command line application (CLI) which uses Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) abstraction to execute commands against databases.

== Concepts

JDBCsh is built against:

* a CLI (so commands): see xref:generated/commands/index.adoc[commands] page,
* a configuration file listing database connections (when not defined thanks a command): see xref:configuration.adoc[configuration] page.

== Specific CLI arguments

The CLI supports a few arguments when launched which configures its behavior independently of the command used.
Some are listed and related to the xref:configuration.adoc[configuration] but some others are global, here they are:

* `-ni` (not interactive): start and stop without entering interactive mode (often used with `-c`),
* `-c $someCommand`: command to launch at startup (after configuration/rc ones if set).
